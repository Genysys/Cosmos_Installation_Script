## Script to Download And Run dependencies for Cosmos 

This is a simple bash script to set up a cosmos node and join the mainnet. 
It has been tested with a Macbook Pro 2018 OSX High Sierra

It is verbatim of this medium post : https://medium.com/cryptium-cosmos/how-to-install-cosmos-and-run-your-full-node-public-testnet-df886dc7b226

Many thanks to meleatrust and cosmaut for debugging so errors I had with it.

The `persistent_peer` in the config.toml fill is currently full so might have issues connecting . Will update with free peers if I find more.
